To start this mod on Linux, start the mod by running ./LinuxLauncher.sh instead
of running it via DDLC.sh or the mod's own script file.
The new script file fixes a issue with mods running on Linux caused by leftover
Ren'Py 6 files.

If you get a error with the script file, make sure the line endings in the file are LF
instead of CRLF; this can be done with dos2unix or with a text editor.

That is all. Happy mod playing!
